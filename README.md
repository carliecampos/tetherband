Tetherband Board and Schematic Files \n

All CAD files and libraries were created using EAGLE CAD. \n

The Tetherband repository includes the board and schematic files for: \n

A. PC-003 
   This is the prototyping board and has an arduino style pin header for analog control of each subsystem. There is no MCU included. \n
B. PC-004
   This is the first completed board and includes the BM832 MCU and a JTAG connector for uploading firmware. The power button was not populated during testing. \n
C. Tesseract Library
   This is the library used for all componenets added to PC-003 and PC-003 that were not included in the standard component libraries.
